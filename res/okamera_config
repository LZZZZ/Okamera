# The --rotation (or -rot) raspivid option
# Set this to 180 if your video is upside down
#
# From raspivid documentation:
# Set image rotation (0-359)
# Sets the rotation of the image in viewfinder and resulting image. This can
# take any value from 0 upwards, but due to hardware constraints only 0, 90, 180
# and 270 degree rotations are supported.
RaspividRotation 0

# The --width (or -w) raspivid option
# Using 1296 here is strongly recommended, for enabling binning, witch reduces
# noise. 1920 won't use the full sensor.
#
# From raspivid documentation:
# Set image width <size>
# Width of resulting video. This should be between 64 and 1920.
RaspividWidth 1296

# The --height (or -h)raspivid option
# Using 968 here is strongly recommended, for enabling binning, witch reduces
# noise. 1080 won't use the full sensor.
#
# From raspivid documentation:
# Set image height <size>
# Height of resulting video. This should be between 64 and 1080.
RaspividHeight 968

# The --qp raspivid option
# Good values are between 16 (for very good quality) and 32 (for very low
# disk space)
#
# From raspivid documentation:
# Set quantisation parameter
# Sets the initial quantisation parameter for the stream. Varies from
# approximately 10 to 40, and will greatly affect the quality of the recording.
# Higher values reduce quality and decrease file size.
RaspividCRF 28

# The --preview (or -p) raspivid option
#
# From raspivid documentation:
# Preview window settings <'x,y,w,h'>
# Allows the user to define the size and location on the screen that the preview
# window will be placed. Note this will be superimposed over the top of any
# other windows/graphics.
RaspividPreview 0,0,800,600

# The --framerate (or -fps) raspivid option
# Using 6 is a good value for saving space, 24 is a good value if space is not a
# problem
#
# From raspivid documentation:
# Specify the frames per second to record
# At present, the minimum frame rate allowed is 2fps, the maximum is 30fps.
# This is likely to change in the future.
RaspividFramerate 6

# Duration of each video files, in seconds
RaspividSegmentDuration 60

# The --intra (or -g) raspivid parameter
# Every segment must start with a intra frame, so the maximum value here is 
# RaspividFramerate * RaspividSegmentDuration
#
# Example: For a 60 second segment with frame rate 12, the maximum value
# is 60 * 12 = 720
#
# From raspivid documentation:
# Specify the intra refresh period (key frame rate/GoP)
# Sets the intra refresh period (GoP) rate for the recorded video. H264 video
# uses a complete frame (I-frame) every intra refresh period from which
# subsequent frames are based. This options specifies the numbers of frames
# between each I-frame. Larger numbers here will reduce the size of the
# resulting video, smaller numbers make the stream more robust to error.
RaspividIntraframeInterval 360

# The --profile (or -pf) raspivid option
#
# From raspivid documentation:
# Specify H264 profile to use for encoding
# Sets the H264 profile to be used for the encoding. Options are:
#   baseline
#   main
#   high
RaspividProfile high

# The width of the thumbnail
# Height will be proportional to the width
ThumbnailWidth 400

# With format should the thumbnails be saved as
# webp has best compression, jpeg is more widely supported
# You can use the file extension of any format that ffmpeg supports
ThumbnailFormat webp

# Extra options to be passed to ffmpeg when creating the thumbnail
# Read the ffmpeg documentation to see the available options for the image
# format you chosen
ThumbnailOptions -compression_level 6 -q:v 85 -preset photo

# Where to save raw video temporary files
# You probably should leave it as is, since /dev/shm is a tmpfs mount, meaning
# that files here are written to RAM
TemporaryDirectory /dev/shm/okamera

# How many temporary raw files can be created before warping
# Just leave this as 3
NumberTemporaryRawFiles 3
