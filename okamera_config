# How many KiB of drive space should be free before saving the next video?
# When there's not enough free space, the oldest videos will be deleted before
# saving the next one

# The angle of rotation for the video
# Don't use values other then 0, 90, 180 and 270
#
# Use 180 here if your video is upside down
RaspividRotation 180

# The width and height, in pixels, of the video to be saved
# Using 1296x968 is recommended because it uses binning on the camera module,
# meaning the noise is reduced and the video files are smaller
#
# Warning: The camera sensor is 4:3, so 16:9 resolutions like 720p and 1080p
# don't make use of the entire sensor
RaspividWidth 1296
RaspividHeight 968

# CRF sets the quality of the video
# Lower values increase the video quality, but make the video files larger
# Sensible values are between 16 (for very good quality) and 32 (for very low
# disk space)
# Don't try to use values lower then 14 here because they will quickly use all
# your disk and you won't see any noticeable difference in quality

# or analog video output
# Read the raspivid documentation if you need to use this
#RaspividPreview 0,0,800,600

# Number of frames per second
# Higher numbers make video more fluid, but increases video file size
# Using 6 is a good value for saving space, 24 is a good value if space is not a
# problem
# Anything between 2 and 30 is fine
RaspividFramerate 6

# Duration of the saved video files, in seconds
RaspividSegmentDuration 60

# h264 video intra frames are complete images, witch are very bandwidth
# consuming
# Other frames are based on intra frames, so they are a lot smaller
# A lower value means your video is more reliable to corruption, faster to seek
# and a lot bigger
# Every segment must start with a intra frame, so the maximum value here is the
# framerate multiplied by segment duration
#
# Example: For a 60 second segment with 12 frames per second, the maximum value
# is 60 * 12 = 720
RaspividIntraframeInterval 360

# h264 profile to be used
# You probably want to leave this as high

# The width of the thumbnail
# Height will be proportional to the width

# With format should the thumbnails be saved as
# webp has best compression, jpeg is more widely supported
# You can use the file extension of any format that ffmpeg supports

# Where to save raw video temporary files
# You probably should leave it as is, since /dev/shm is a tmpfs mount, meaning
# that files here are written to RAM
